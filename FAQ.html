<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">What is Bython?</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Bython is a free learning platform that helps people around the world to learn programming in python.
 We help you learn the basics to the language which are covered in all topics. Once you feel confident about the topics we suggest various resources such as third-party websites, books, IDE's and much more!
 Bython allows you to take a quiz after every two topics, this allows you to go over the topics multiple times and revise topics you are not too confident in.  </h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Where can I learn more about python?</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">If statements are how programs make decisions, in python they are most commonly used with logical conditons.
As seen above the exact same peice of python code will be printed with the if statement, this was determined by the data assigned to the varibale.
Remember: The above statement will return a result and this is becuase indentation has been included within the statement. This is very important that this included with all if statements within python

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">When are the quizzes taken?</h1></font></u>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">Quizzes are taken after every two topics. If you do not feel comfortable with the two topics, you can look over them again and again until you do.
When it comes to programming practice is key. Doing it once wont stick in you head however looking over and trying examples will most definelty help you with your programming journey.
 </h2></font>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">Quizzes in later topics may also include subjects from early topics, this is done as a way to refresh your memory and see if you still have the knowledge. We suggest completing all of the quizzes before moving on to any of our suggested resources.
