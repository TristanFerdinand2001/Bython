<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Variables</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't have a command for declaring variables. 
  This Topic shows you the basics of python variables from assigning data to the variables to printing and returning the data type. 
  This is most definetley the best place to start your journey. This Topic will also give you examples and mention how this may differ in various other languages.
This will most definetly help you prepare for the first quiz. <b> Press any of the topics if you wish to learn more, this will help you with your programming journey!</b> </h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Assigning Attributes</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/variable1.jpg" height="300" width="600"></p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Variables are found in all programming langauges and in python they do not need to be declared by its data type.
 In python all you need to do is assign the value/data to it as seen in the example above. 
In the example above x is assigned the value of 5 and y is assigned the name "John".
The variable x is known as an int or integer (number) and y is known as a string which is a set of characters. String must be declared with speech marks. 
This lets python know that it is a string. As seen above these variables are then printed, this will display the variables data to the user.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Data Types</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/variable2.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">There most common variables are: <u>int</u>(numbers),<u> string</u>(characters) and <u> float</u>(numbers with decimal places) and there are many more.
 Variables do not need to be declared with any particular datatype, and can even change type after they have been set.
This is not seen in many languages. This is why python is a great language to learn before moving on to others which reuqire more to be done
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with type. 
This is seen in the next example below.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Print Type()</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/variable3.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">If you wish to print the type of you can print as seen in the example above.
This will verify what data type a variable is. The variable x will output a an integer becuase it is a number/integer and y will output a string, this is because the variable is charaters within speechmarks If you wish to learn more, you can check any of our third-party webistes.

<b><u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align="center">Casting</h1></font></u></b>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/varcasting.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Casting allows you to see what type of data your variable is.
this is a great way to check if you are unsure of the datatype. Casting may also change some data slightly.
As seen in the above image, x will go from 3 to '3' which is a string, y will remain the same but z will change from 3 to 3.0 which is a float number.

<b><u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align="center">Strings</h1></font></u></b>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/stringx.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">String are found in all programming languages, this includes languages such as: Java, C and C+.
Strings are characters within speech marks, this doesn't need to begin with a capital like some other languages however people new to python tend to make similar mistakes.
Thankfully pyhton allows for quotation marks to be used aswell. 
In other languages this may sometimes be only speech marks such as java. Check any of our suggested third-party websites, they will go more in depth and cover other topics related to strings.
