<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Control Flow</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated. The control flow of a 
Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. All of the following play a major part in determining the route the program will take.
Control flow is seen in all programming languages and with various routes, this allows programs to have a number of different outputs( you will see this when learning more in other topics and websites).

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center"> For Loops</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/controlflow1.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters as demostrated in the following:

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages such as java or C+, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">While Statement</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/whilex.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">While a condition is true, a set of statements can be carried out using the while loop.
The while statement is commonly used with other controlflow statements which determines a programs overall path and output.
 The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">The break statement</h1></font></u>

<p align = "center"><img src="images/break11.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The break statement allows us to stop a loop before it has looped through all of the ietems in the list, tuple etc. This is seen in alot of programs and you will definetley see this during your programming journey.
In the example above the loop is 'broke' once x == "banana". This results in only the 1st element being printed (apple).
Break statements are seen in numerous languages and you will see this with most programming languages

 <u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">The continue statement</h1></font></u>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The Continue statement allows us to stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next. This is these in the example below:</h2>

 <h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The Continue statement allows us to stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next. This is these in the example below:
The example shows a list of 'fruits' which involves a continue statement, this statement skips the banana variable. This is not included in the output.
 The output would be the following:
