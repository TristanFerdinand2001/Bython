<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">OOP(Object-Orientated Programming)</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Python like many othe programming languages is not just procedural but also Object Orientated.
Almost everything in python in an object, this meaning all peices of data such as variables with its properties and methods.
A class is known as an object 'blueprint' for creating objects.</h2></font>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Object-Orientated programming in most commonly seen in other languages such as Java, C+ and many more. This is a shift from using single variables to using object 
which are assigned multiple parts of data. An example is a 'car' object, the car will have a brand (string), VIN (int), Year of Car(int) twoSeats? (boolean) - This could be endless. However we only focus on what data is required for the software.</h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Classes and object</h1></font></u>

<p align = "center"><img src="images/objmain.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Classes and object are used in most languages, this allows multiple peices of data to be assigned to an object.
These objects can be the same or differ but these are then kept within class/s. In the following examples, we will show you the basics to both classes and object.
If you feel confident you can try our quiz or move onto any of our suggested resouces regarding OOP.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Creating a Class</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/obj1.jpg" height="300" width="750"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Creating a class is done using the keyword 'class' - this is followed by the name of the class.
A class can consist of just one object or multiple objects, all of these object have different values/data assigned to them.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Creating an Object</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/obj2.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">When objects are created, they are created within a class and they can start with just a variable name.
An object needs a purpose and most important attributes. This is how different objects differ in a peice of software. If you were creating software for cars, you know some attributes may be similar however they always will slightly differe making them unique.
Objects are assigned data which is fit for that object and they may have object which are extremley similar or not.
<h2 align="center">
As seen above there is an object being created, this object is being called p1. The object is not assigned any data however the value of x is being printed, this was shown in the last example, the value is 5.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">The __init__() function</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/obj3.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">The __str__() function</h1></font></u>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:
