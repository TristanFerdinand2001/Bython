 <u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Bython's Suggested Third-Party Websites</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">There are many websites we suggest checking once you have completed the Bython quizzes.
This will allow you to expand your python knowledge and even perhaps move onto different languages that you may use in the future.
Common languages used include C and Java, looking into these languages will expand your programming language and hopfully help you in the future, should you need to use any of the languages.
W3 Schools also covers a variety if back-end languages such as javascript and SQL, these languages allow you to see what is going on behind the scenes such as database and other types of server communications. This page may be updated due to new websites or policie changes.

<p align = "center"><img src="images/programiz.png" height="200" width="600"> </p>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Programiz is a great place to continue your programming journey.
Programiz is 'Is for programmers by programmers' - Programiz consisits of even more python  techniques that you can use whilst programming.
Programiz also has courses which can be complete. When you feel confident with python we suggest moving on to another language such as C or Java.
Programiz also consists of IDE's for all of the languages covered. If there are any topics you are unsure about please refer back to the topic on Bython as we have tried to simplify them as much as so users have a better understanding of the topics covered.

<p align = "center"><img src="images/w3.png" height="250" width="300"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">W3 Schools is a perfect place to learn if you wish to learn more about OOP in python and if you want to learn any other languages.
W3 covers most commonly seen languages (both back-end and front-end) this includes: C, C++, Java, Ruby, SQL and many more. We suggest this website has all you need to learn about a varierty of languages.
If you are not sure about any of the topics, check another website which will hopefully explain them better for you.

<p align = "center"><img src="images/sololearn.png" height="300" width="300"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Bython highly suggests Sololearn after completion as you are able to complete quizzes in a number of languages.
Once complete you will receive a certificate. This is doen with pretty much all languages such as C, Java, Python(which will include more OOP) and many more.
If you already know parts to a language you can take shortcuts once provoving you know the content via a quiz. Code can also be shared with fellow Sololearn leaners and you can recive help from them if you are stuggling with your code.</h2>

<a href="https://www.replit.com"><u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Replit</h1></font></u></a>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/Replit.png" height="300" width="300"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Replit is home to IDE's for the majority of programming languages. This includes common languages suxxh as python and C however there are more langauges which arent as common.
These languages are Go, Ruby, Lua, Haskell and many more, this once again allowing users to expand their knowledge if they so wish to.
Replit has a strong community and asking for help is common. Repls (code) can be shared with other users allowing for members of the community to help and point out any errors you may have made.
Bython definelty recomends Replit and its learning procedures.

<a href="https://www.codepen.io"><b><u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align="center">CodePen</h1></font></u></b></a>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/codepen.png" height="300" width="300"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">CodePen is a social devlopment enviroment, this allows users to write code on a browser and see the results asthough they are using a professional IDE.
This is a highly-recomended website as it allows users of any skill set execute their code and keep it assigned to an account. Bython suggest checking out this website if you have completed all of the python topics and you are wanting to look into web development.
This is because CodePen is primarily focused on web-devlopment, this includes languages such as HTML, CSS and JS.
