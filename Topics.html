<ul><a href = "Variables.html"><u><li>Variables</li></u></a>
  <p>  Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python doesn't have a command for declaring variables. 
  This Topic shows you the basics of python variables from assigning data to the variables to printing and returning the data type. 
  This is most definetley the best place to start your journey. This Topic will also give you examples and mention how this may differ in various other languages.
This will most definetly help you prepare for the first quiz.  </p>





<a href = "Conditions.html"> <u> <li>Conditions</li></u></a>
 <p>Python has many conditions just like any other programming language. Conditions will be used throughout your programming journey. 
 Conditions work with <u>if statements</u> and they will determine the output of your program. 
 Python conditions are a great way to start using logical conditions, you will see these in various other programming languages such as Java, C and many more.   </p>
 
 
<a href="Operators.html"> <u> <li>Operators</li></u></a>
<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, this is seen in numerous programming languages. 
Operators will help your programs make calculations and comparisions with data. 
This topic covers all of the commonly used operators which allow your programs to make decisisions. 
Third-party websites which we recommend go more in depth and cover logical and bitwise operators.
</p>

<a href="Control Flow.html"><u><li>Control Flow</u></a>
<p>Control flow is a big part of programming. This determines which route the software will take, this determining the output of the program.
This is most commonly done with if and else statements. If you feel confident with this topic make sure to complete the quiz and check a third-party website.
All of them go more in depth with control flow and this will help you with your programming journey. </p></li>



<a href="Loops and Iterators.html"> <u><li>Loops and Iterators</u></a>
 <p>Here is where you will get your first taste of object orientated programming. Iterables are objects which contain multiple peices of data, this is common in all programming languages.
The simples in python include: <b>lists, sets and tuples</b> this allows multiple peices of data to be stored in the same variable. You will also have a look at <b>For loops</b>, these are used for iterating over a sequence.
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
 </p></li>
 
 
 
<a href="Functions.html"> <u> <li>Functions</li></u></a>
 <p>Functions are extremley common and it is best to learn how to create these in a simple language such as python before trying in other languages such as java or C.
 A function is a piece of code that only runs when it is called. Functions can then return data as a result. By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. 
 Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
 
 
 
<a href="Lists, Tuples and Sets.html"><u> <li>Lists, Tuple and Sets</li></u></a>
 <p>Python has a few common built-in datatypes. the most common are Lists, Tuples and Sets. These datatypes allow for multiple peices of dat to be stored in the sme place.
 Although these datatypes are used for the same thing, they do slighlty differ. We show you how they are all slightly different and allow for a number of variables to be stored in the same place.
 Lists are the most common whereas sets are not used as much in  python.



<a href="Inheritance.html"><u><li>Inheritance</li></u></a>
<p>Basic data structures are methods to store and organize data so it can be easily used to 
perform operations to get desired results. 
We will show you commonly used data structures such as: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs.
We hope that you will be able to extend and learn more during your programming journey.



<a href="Arrays.html"><u><li>Arrays</li></u></a>
 <p>Chained Conditionals (also known as nested if statements) is a conditional statement, 
 which can be used in various forms to check a condition or multiple conditions and to perform the specified action or actions, if the particular condition is true. 
 The output is determined by the multiple if, else and elif statements. We will show you how to create these and how they function.
 
 
 
<a href="OOP.html"><u> <li>OOP</li></u></a>
<p>In this topic we introduce you to OOP (Object-Orientated Programming). This is where you start to use Classes and Objects. Classes can contain an object.
 These objects have their own methods and attributes. OOP is found is near enough all programming lanaguages. This topic will be a massive help for your programming journey.
 We introduce you to the simple concepts and we will show you how you can further enhance your skills.
