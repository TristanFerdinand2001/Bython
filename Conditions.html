<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Conditions</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Python has many conditions just like any other programming language. 
Conditions will be used throughout your programming journey. Conditions work with if statements and they will determine the output of your program. 
Python conditions are a great way to start using logical conditions, you will see these in various other programming languages such as Java, C and many more.   </h2></font>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Conditions are most commonly determined with logical conditions and if statements, else statements and elif statements.
This is how programs make decisions and the output will be determined by the if, else and elif statements and these statements will include logical conditions which allows varibales to be compared.
The program will compare data from both variables to determine and output, you will most definetley see these numerous times tgroughout your programming journey.   </h2></font>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
Logical conditions are used to both compare variables, and if these conditions will either be true or false.
These conditions will determine the route your program takes, as seen in the above example, there are six common conditions which are often used to compare variables and their data.
The most common way these condtions are used are in if statements, you will see how if statements and logical conditions work together to determine a result in the following examples.
These are used in the most common programming lanaguages such as java, C and many others however they may differ in some other languages. 
If you wish to learn more about Logical Conditions, out third-party webiste go in depth into other languages such as java and C.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Indentation</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/cond2.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
You will see this in many other programming langauges, indentation is always used when using if, else and elif statements.
Leanring this now will prepare you for other languages which will expect this aswell. This is why python is a great language to learn as a first langauge.
As seen above indentation is used after the if statement, this is done by pressing enter after the if statement, in this case "if b > a:" although this statement is correct, because indentation is not correct, an error will be recieved.
This is becuase indentation has not been involved within this statement. This is crucial and is important to learn because a mistake so small can alter the output of the program.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">If, else and elif</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/cond3.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">If statements are how programs make decisions, in python they are most commonly used with logical conditons.
As seen above the exact same peice of python code will be printed with the if statement, this was determined by the data assigned to the varibale.
Remember: The above statement will return a result and this is becuase indentation has been included within the statement. This is very important that this included with all if statements within python

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">As seen above multiple if statements can be run (executed) at the same time, this allows the program to determine the result of more than on statement at the same time.
This may alter the overall output of the program. When using python and any language, you will most likeley be required to do this. The example above will return an error, this is becuase the first statement has not involve indentation.
Using multiple if statments is different to using the else statement as seen in the next example.    </h2> </font>

<p align = "center"><img src="images/elsecond.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The else statement is an alternative statement, this meaning that the else statement will not be executed straight away because it isn't and if statement.
Else statements are only ran (executed) if the if statement is false. As seen in the example above, there are two possible outputs.
If variable b was greater than variable a then the first statement would be outputed (printed/displayed) however it isn't.
This is when the else statement takes over and prints the alternative "b is not greater than a".
This is extremeley common in programming and there are always alternative routes if statements are false.<h2 align="center">
