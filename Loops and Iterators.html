<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Loops and Iterators</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
These are commonly used with if and else statements. This allowing the output determined by any values which are within the 'iterators'.
Once again these are classed as objects, so this will be your first taste of object-orientated programming languages as such in other langauges such as java or C++.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center"> Iterator vs Iterable</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:

The following returns an iteratator from the tuple and prints out the value of alll variables included such as the following:

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Looping Through an Iterator</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">It is common to use the for statement/loop to iterate through an iterable object.
 This is seen in the following example: </h2></font>
 <p align = "center"><img src="images/it3.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
 <font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop.
 You can also iterate the characters of a string, this is seen in the following:</h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Create an Iterator</h1></font></u>

<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.
The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.

 <h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The example above involves an iterator that returns numbers, starting from 1 and this will be increased (returning 1,2,3,4 and 5) </h2> </font>

 <u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">StopIteration</h1></font></u>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.
To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:  </h2></font>
