<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Unlike many other programming languages python doesn't have built-in support for arrays, python lists can be used as an alternative.</h2></font>


<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center"> This topic shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.</h2></font>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
An array is a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time. These are seen in multiple programming languages.
As mentioned prior python doesn't have built-in support for arrays, this is why lists are used. The example above shows how arrays are laid out in python.
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a certain car? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? - this is where arrays come in.
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

<p align = "center"><img src="images/arrays4.jpg" height="200" width="800"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">You can use the append() method to add an element to an array.
This is seen in the example above, this can't be done in all programming languages.
The example shows the car "Honda" being added to the array, this can be done as much as possible, just like lists this allows for multiple peices of data to be stored in the same place.

<p align = "center"><img src="images/arrays2.jpg" height="200" width="800"> </p>

<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">When trying to access an element from an array in pyhton, you refer to the index number of that element.
This is seen in the example above, remember that the index number for both lists and arrays is 0 </h2> </font>
 </h2></font>
 <p align = "center"><img src="images/arrays3.jpg" height="200" width="800"> </p>
 <font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Once you have located the element in the array, you can then modify the value of the array element.
 This is seen in the example above, the first element is being altered into the car "Toyota".
 As soon as this is input and printed out the new index element should be clear.</h2> </font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Removing elements from Arrays</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/arrayx.jpg" height="300" width="600"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">You can use the pop() method to remove any of the elements from the array, this once again can't be done in all languages.
Python allows all methods which are used with lists to be used with python 'arrays'. The example above shows the second element being removed from the array.
Aswell as  the pop() method, the remove() method can also be used to remove elements from the array. This is shown in the example below.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Array Methods </h1></font></u>
<h2 align="center"><font color ="lightblue">Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.
These methods allow users to do multiple things with arrays/lists. such as the following:
