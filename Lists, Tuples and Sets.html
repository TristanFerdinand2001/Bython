<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Lists, Tuples and Sets</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center"></b>List, tuples and Sets are an important part to python. 
This allows multiple pieces of data to be stored within either a List, Tuple or Set.
 Although these are all very similar, they have different qualities, one example is Sets don't allow duplicate peices of data whereas Lists do.
 Tuples are also unchangable, this being the main difference between lists and tuples. Read more below.</h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Lists</h1></font></u>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Python Lists are used to store multiple peices of data within the same variable. Lists are of 4 built-in-datatypes used to store collections of data.
The other three are: Sets, Tuples and Ditonaries. They all allow for multiple peices of dat to be stored in a single variable however they do have some slight differences.
 </h2></font>
 <p align = "center"><img src="images/list1.jpg" height="300" width="800"></p>
 <font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">The list above has three elements, these are all fruits (apple, banana and cherry). This list has allowed three strings to be contained within a single variable.
 List items are ordered (from 0+), changeable and allow for duplicate values. List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
 </h2></font>
  <p align = "center"><img src="images/list2.jpg" height="300" width="800"></p>
   <font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">When saying ordered, this meaning that lists are ordered in the sequence they are added to the list. Every new item is added to the back of the list however this can be altered with certain methods.
   Lists allow for duplicates, as seen above the list contains two strings which are both "apple" and "cherry", this shows that duplicates can be added to a list, this will differ with different types of 'data containers'. As seen in both images duplicates or not the list can still then be printed.
 </h2></font>

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Tuples</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/tuple.jpg" height="300" width="800"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">
Just like lists, Tuples are used to store multiple items although tuples are in order, they are unchangable. Unlike lists which can be altered, tuples can not and instead of square brackets used, tuples use round brackets.
Tuples also allow for duplicates just like lists, this applies for all datatypes, in the example above the tuple consists of fruits but once again just like lists, the tuple has allowed for duplicates. (cherry and apple).
This tuple can then be printed out with no issues just like the list.

<u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Sets</h1></font></u>
<p align = "center"><img src="images/set1.jpg" height="300" width="800"> </p>
<font color ="lightblue"><h2 align="center">Sets are used to store multiple items within a single variable. 
Sets are another type of built-in data types in python allowing to be used to store a collection of data.
A set is a collection of dat which is unordered, unindexed and also unchangable. Although set items are unchangable, you can still add and remove items.

 </h2></font>
 <u><font color="lightblue"><h1 align ="center">Duplicates are not allowed</h1></font></u>
<font color="lightblue"> <h2 align = "center"><img src="images/set22.jpg" height="300" width="800"> </p>
 <p align = "center">Unlike the other mentioned built-in data types, sets doesnt allow for duplicates, this is including all datatypes.
If you try to print the same peice of data, this will be ignored. This is shown in the example above, the second apple wont be printed in the output.
This is another part which makes sets unqiues to other bulit-in data types.
 </h2></font>
 
 <font color="lightblue"> <h2 align = "center"><img src="images/setx.jpg" height="300" width="800"> </p>
 <h2 align = "center">Sets also consider 0 to be false and 1 to be true. This is seen in multiple places within programming however this can cause issues.
 The example above won't print out the number 1, this is because the boolean value of True already represents the number 1, therefore these are classed as duplicate peices of data.
 This would not be the case when using any of the previous examples such as a tuple or list. If 0 and False were in the same set, this would also cause issues. Depending on the order one of the variables wont print out.
